# Generate adversarail sequence
for a certain attacked websites, we use a series of packages  cellected in training datasets to generate adversarial samples respectively,
and there are two methods. For example, we have 10 packages for website A, so we can generate 20 adversarial samples, which can be used for GA initialization, diversity of sample will be helpful to find a rational answer.
